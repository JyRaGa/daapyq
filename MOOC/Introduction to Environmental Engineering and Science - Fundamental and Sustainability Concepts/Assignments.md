# NPTEL Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science
## Week 1 Assignment: Fundamental and Sustainability Concepts
**Course:** NOC26_GE27 (Jan-Apr 2026)
**Exam Date:** April 17, 2026


### 1. IPAT Equation
**Question:** The equation I = P × A × T signifies that environmental impact is a function of:
* **Correct Answer:** **(b) Population, Affluence, and Technology**
> **Note:** Proposed by Ehrlich and Holdren (1971), where Impact ($I$) depends on Population ($P$), Affluence/Consumption ($A$), and Technology efficiency ($T$).


### 2. Historical Impacts
**Question:** Compared to pre-Common Era human impacts, post-1800 environmental impacts are best described as:
* **Correct Answer:** **(c) Exponentially higher and global**
> **Note:** This era, driven by the Industrial Revolution and fossil fuel use, is often referred to as the "Great Acceleration."


### 3. Ecological Footprint
* **Question:** The ecological footprint of a population primarily measures:
* **Correct Answer:** **(c) Land and water required to sustain a given lifestyle**
> **Note:** It quantifies the biologically productive area needed to produce the resources consumed and assimilate the waste generated by a population.


### 4. Triple Bottom Line
**Question:** Sustainability, according to the Triple Bottom Line, integrates:
* **Correct Answer:** **(b) Environment, economy, and society**
> **Note:** Often referred to as the "3 Ps": People (Social), Planet (Environmental), and Profit (Economic).


### 5. Brundtland Definition
**Question:** The Brundtland Commission’s definition of sustainable development emphasizes:
* **Correct Answer:** **(d) Meeting present needs without compromising future needs**
> **Note:** This definition comes from the 1987 UN report "Our Common Future" (also known as the Brundtland Report).


### 6. Montreal Protocol
**Question:** The Montreal Protocol (1987) is best known for addressing:
* **Correct Answer:** **(a) Ozone-depleting substances**
> **Note:** It successfully mandated the phase-out of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to protect the stratospheric ozone layer.


### 7. Design Stage Importance
**Question:** In sustainability engineering, the design stage is critical because it:
* **Correct Answer:** **(d) Offers maximum degrees of freedom for sustainable choices**
> **Note:** Approximately 80% of a product's life-cycle environmental impact is locked in during the design phase.


### 8. Efficiency Limitations
**Question:** A key limitation of relying solely on efficiency improvements for sustainability is that:
* **Correct Answer:** **(c) Efficiency may lead to overuse of finite resources**
> **Note:** This is known as the **Jevons Paradox** (or Rebound Effect)—where increased efficiency lowers costs, driving up demand and total consumption.


### 9. Environmental History
**Question:** The Cuyahoga River fire (1969) significantly contributed to the establishment of:
* **Correct Answer:** **(a) Clean Water Act and EPA**
> **Note:** The visual of a burning river in Ohio galvanized public opinion, leading to the creation of the US EPA and major environmental laws in the 1970s.


### 10. Urban Impact
**Question:** Urban areas occupy approximately 1% of the Earth’s land surface but contribute to nearly:
* **Correct Answer:** **(c) 60–70% of anthropogenic GHG emissions**
> **Note:** Cities are dense hubs of energy consumption, transportation, and waste generation, resulting in a disproportionately high carbon footprint.
