## Week 1 Assignment: Fundamental and Sustainability Concepts
**Course:** NOC26_GE27 (Jan-Apr 2026)
**Exam Date:** April 17, 2026


### 1. IPAT Equation
**Question:** The equation I = P × A × T signifies that environmental impact is a function of:
* **Correct Answer:** **(b) Population, Affluence, and Technology**
> **Note:** Proposed by Ehrlich and Holdren (1971), where Impact ($I$) depends on Population ($P$), Affluence/Consumption ($A$), and Technology efficiency ($T$).


### 2. Historical Impacts
**Question:** Compared to pre-Common Era human impacts, post-1800 environmental impacts are best described as:
* **Correct Answer:** **(c) Exponentially higher and global**
> **Note:** This era, driven by the Industrial Revolution and fossil fuel use, is often referred to as the "Great Acceleration."


### 3. Ecological Footprint
* **Question:** The ecological footprint of a population primarily measures:
* **Correct Answer:** **(c) Land and water required to sustain a given lifestyle**
> **Note:** It quantifies the biologically productive area needed to produce the resources consumed and assimilate the waste generated by a population.


### 4. Triple Bottom Line
**Question:** Sustainability, according to the Triple Bottom Line, integrates:
* **Correct Answer:** **(b) Environment, economy, and society**
> **Note:** Often referred to as the "3 Ps": People (Social), Planet (Environmental), and Profit (Economic).


### 5. Brundtland Definition
**Question:** The Brundtland Commission’s definition of sustainable development emphasizes:
* **Correct Answer:** **(d) Meeting present needs without compromising future needs**
> **Note:** This definition comes from the 1987 UN report "Our Common Future" (also known as the Brundtland Report).


### 6. Montreal Protocol
**Question:** The Montreal Protocol (1987) is best known for addressing:
* **Correct Answer:** **(a) Ozone-depleting substances**
> **Note:** It successfully mandated the phase-out of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to protect the stratospheric ozone layer.


### 7. Design Stage Importance
**Question:** In sustainability engineering, the design stage is critical because it:
* **Correct Answer:** **(d) Offers maximum degrees of freedom for sustainable choices**
> **Note:** Approximately 80% of a product's life-cycle environmental impact is locked in during the design phase.


### 8. Efficiency Limitations
**Question:** A key limitation of relying solely on efficiency improvements for sustainability is that:
* **Correct Answer:** **(c) Efficiency may lead to overuse of finite resources**
> **Note:** This is known as the **Jevons Paradox** (or Rebound Effect)—where increased efficiency lowers costs, driving up demand and total consumption.


### 9. Environmental History
**Question:** The Cuyahoga River fire (1969) significantly contributed to the establishment of:
* **Correct Answer:** **(a) Clean Water Act and EPA**
> **Note:** The visual of a burning river in Ohio galvanized public opinion, leading to the creation of the US EPA and major environmental laws in the 1970s.


### 10. Urban Impact
**Question:** Urban areas occupy approximately 1% of the Earth’s land surface but contribute to nearly:
* **Correct Answer:** **(c) 60–70% of anthropogenic GHG emissions**
> **Note:** Cities are dense hubs of energy consumption, transportation, and waste generation, resulting in a disproportionately high carbon footprint.

## Week 2 Assignment: Mass Concentration Units and Quantitative Measurements
**Course:** NOC26_GE27 (Jan-Apr 2026)
**Exam Date:** April 17, 2026

### 1. Mass Concentration Units
**Question:** The unit μg/m³ is most appropriately used for reporting pollutant concentrations in:
*   **Correct Answer:** **(d) Air**
    > **Note:** The unit μg/m³ (micrograms per cubic meter) is the standard unit for measuring air pollutant concentrations because air pollutants are typically present in very low concentrations.

### 2. Gas Concentration Conversion Law
**Question:** When converting gaseous concentrations between ppmv and μg/m³, which law is fundamentally required?
*   **Correct Answer:** **(c) Ideal gas law**
    > **Note:** The ideal gas law (PV = nRT) relates the concentration, pressure, and temperature of gases, which is essential for converting between volume-based (ppmv) and mass-based (μg/m³) concentration units.

### 3. Partial Pressure in Gas Mixtures
**Question:** In a gas mixture, the partial pressure of a component gas is proportional to its:
*   **Correct Answer:** **(c) Mole (or volume) fraction**
    > **Note:** According to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the partial pressure of a component in a gas mixture equals the total pressure multiplied by its mole fraction.

### 4. Molarity vs Molality
**Question:** Molarity differs from molality because molarity depends on:
*   **Correct Answer:** **(b) Temperature and volume**
    > **Note:** Molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution, and since volume changes with temperature, molarity is temperature-dependent. Molality (moles per kg of solvent) is temperature-independent.

### 5. Nitrogen Reporting Units
**Question:** Reporting nitrogen as mg N/L instead of mg/L of individual species is useful because it:
*   **Correct Answer:** **(b) Accounts for all nitrogen forms on a common basis**
    > **Note:** Expressing nitrogen concentration as mg N/L allows comparison of different nitrogen species (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia) on a common elemental basis, simplifying analysis and regulatory compliance.

### 6. Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS)
**Question:** Volatile suspended solids (VSS) are primarily an indicator of:
*   **Correct Answer:** **(a) Organic matter content**
    > **Note:** VSS represents the portion of suspended solids that volatilizes at high temperatures (typically 550°C), which corresponds primarily to organic matter, making it useful for assessing biological treatment processes.

### 7. Method Detection Limit (MDL)
**Question:** The Method Detection Limit (MDL) represents:
*   **Correct Answer:** **(d) The minimum concentration measurable with 99% confidence**
    > **Note:** MDL is the minimum concentration that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is greater than zero, establishing the lower bound of reliable analytical measurements.

### 8. Central Tendency for Log-Normal Data
**Question:** When environmental data are log-normally distributed, the most appropriate measure of central tendency is the:
*   **Correct Answer:** **(d) Geometric mean**
    > **Note:** For log-normally distributed data, the geometric mean is the most appropriate measure because it accounts for the skewed nature of the distribution. It is calculated as the nth root of the product of n values.

### 9. Partial Pressure Calculation
**Question:** What is the partial pressure of CO₂ if its concentration is 420 ppmv and atmospheric pressure is 1 atm?
*   **Correct Answer:** **(b) 4.2 × 10⁻⁴ atm**
    > **Note:** Partial pressure = (concentration in ppmv / 10⁶) × total pressure = (420 / 10⁶) × 1 atm = 4.2 × 10⁻⁴ atm.

### 10. Water Analysis Validation
**Question:** A mineral water analysis gives total cations = 1.0 × 10⁻³ eqv/L and total anions = 0.95 × 10⁻³ eqv/L. Is the analysis acceptable?
*   **Correct Answer:** **(a) Yes**
    > **Note:** The electroneutrality check requires total cations to approximately equal total anions. Accepted difference is <5% using c-a/c+a * 100 = 2.56%.
